# the-solar-sytem

The project explains about the demonstration of our solar system along with some animations which brings you closer to the furthest reaches of our world and lets you experience lots of fantastic space sceneries. Along with that it tells you about the career that explores space and some information with interesting facts about each planet. It aspires to be the most illustrative, easy to understand and simple to use space model. Most importantly it tells you about how unique earth is and how we should protect our nature which we are destroying in some or the other way.

The aim of doing this project is to let everyone take a deep dive into our galaxy and know about how our solar system looks and some detailed information regarding it. This will include some animations which will let you experience a great view of our solar system. Along with that it will motivate our youth with some interesting fact and their career scope in the space organisation. We want to do this project this so that everyone have at least the basic details about what is going on outside our world.

Technologies used to make this project are VS Code and we will refer internet along with beta-labs website and some animation videos to implement this project.
